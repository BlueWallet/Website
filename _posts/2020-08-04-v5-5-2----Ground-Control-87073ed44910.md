To Major Tom

Today we are releasing BlueWallet v5.5.2 and it brings 2 features that I would like to introduce and give a little walk through.

### 1\. Push notifications

To make push notifications possible we develop a new Free and Open Source service called “Ground Control”.

Ground Control is a **notifications center for Bitcoin wallets**, that you will be able to run in a self-hosted fashion to not be depend on BlueWallet’s server.

It supports Bitcoin and LNDhub, receive transactions, pending and confirmed onchain transactions. It processes blocks and a mempool in search of subscribed onchain addresses in order to provide notifications for users. Built with typescript, expressjs, mariadb & [openapi](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlueWallet/GroundControl/master/openapi.yaml).

You can also easily setup your own Ground Control server, and have a more privacy-aware push notifications setup.

### 2\. LNurl-pay

Services that support LNurl-Pay (like [@bitrefill](http://twitter.com/bitrefill "Twitter profile for @bitrefill")) allow you to pay or easily repeat a payment without you having to open this service or ask to generate an invoice. Think about it as a UX improvement for Lightning.

LNurl-Pay can have some interesting use cases in the future, and going towards a more mobile-friendly type of interaction. For instance:

*   Donation sites
*   Restaurant menus
*   Pricing tags in market shelves
*   Bike/scooter-sharing services and other indie stuff
*   Any site that wants to accept payments
