Version 5.3.5 of [BlueWallet Bitcoin wallet](https://bluewallet.io) is out on iOS and android. And, as usual is full of improvements and bug fixes. Let’s take a closer look on them.

This version includes a major refactor on all wallet types. With **PSBT**, **Send** and **SendMax** features added to **all wallets**. Includes Bread wallet type, allowing easy import to BlueWallet.
