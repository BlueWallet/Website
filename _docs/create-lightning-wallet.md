#### Connecting to your own LNDHub

Lightning functionality in BlueWallet is powered by [LNDHub](http://lndhub.io/), an open source service that we created for this purpose. You will need to add your node (lndhub) uri to this form in order to connect to it.


When you're ready, you can click on "Create" to make your new wallet.
