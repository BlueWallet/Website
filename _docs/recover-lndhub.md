With the [sunset of lndhub.io](/sunsetting-lndhub/) it is not possible to use the service anymore. However you can request to recover your balance.

You will need two items to be able to recover, your **account information** and a **bitcoin onchain address**. See the details below. 

### 1- Where to get your account information
Inside your lightning wallet you are going to find on the top right the options menu. Usually with the 3 dots icon (...). After you tap the menu you will be taken to the wallet options screen, where you will find the "backup/export" option. This is your account information and starts with **lndhub://**. 

Make sure it doesnt end with `.onion` - such wallets are usually hosted on private nodes, such as Umbrel.

### 2- Bitcoin address
You will also need to provide a regular bitcoin address in order to receive your withdrawal. Transactions are usually processed monthly, begining of each month, so please wait till a new batch of transactions is done.
